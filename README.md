# Employee Password Generator

The Password Generator web application enables employees to generate secure, random passwords based on criteria they define: length, uppercase/lowercase use, special character use, and number use. 

It features dynamically updating HTML and CSS, powered by JavaScript code. This runs in any modern web browser and leverages a responsive user interface to adapt to multiple screen sizes.
